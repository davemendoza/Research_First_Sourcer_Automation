## Project Overview

The AI Talent Engine is a research-grade talent intelligence system designed to help Talent Acquisition organizations identify, evaluate, and act on elite AI talent at scale.

This repository contains the Python execution layer of that system.

This is not a sourcing tool.

It is a recruitment research collaborator for Talent Acquisition and Recruiting Operations, built to operationalize deep technical research and convert it into hiring-ready intelligence.

Unlike resume-driven or Boolean keyword-based recruiting systems, this system analyzes verifiable technical work, including publications, citation networks, open-source models, GitHub contributions, and patents, and produces outputs grounded in traceable evidence rather than inferred skills.


## Dual-Layer Architecture

The AI Talent Engine is composed of two tightly integrated layers.


### 1. Python Automation Layer (Execution Layer)

Responsible for deterministic and auditable operations, including:

- Structured and semi-structured data ingestion
- Evidence extraction, normalization, and validation
- Deterministic enrichment, scoring, and tier assignment
- Ethical public-source contact discovery and verification
- Generation of stable, hiring-manager-ready exports


### 2. GPT Reasoning Layer (Interpretation Layer)

Responsible for evidence-bound reasoning, including:

- Objective role classification using multi-signal logic
- Context-aware interpretation of verified evidence
- Narrative synthesis and ranking explanation
- Manager-ready hiring recommendations


Python defines ground truth.  
GPT provides reasoned synthesis over verified evidence.


## Full Capability Checklist


### Core Architecture

- Dual-layer system with Python execution and GPT reasoning
- Evidence-first and traceable by design
- Repeatable and auditable workflow outputs


### Python Automation (Execution Layer)

- Structured and semi-structured data ingestion
- Evidence extraction and normalization
- Deterministic enrichment and scoring
- Ethical public-source contact discovery and verification
- Stable, hiring-ready CSV and Excel exports


### GPT Reasoning Layer

- Evidence-bound reasoning constraints
- Objective multi-signal role classification
- Ranking justification and narrative synthesis


### Canonical AI Role Types

- Frontier and Foundational AI Scientist
- RLHF and Alignment Engineer or Researcher
- Applied AI and Machine Learning Engineer
- AI Infrastructure and Systems Engineer
- Developer Evangelist and Research Advocate

Each role includes:

- Preset signal schemas
- Role-specific weighting logic
- Explicit exclusion rules to reduce false positives


### Standardized Candidate Assessment

Each candidate assessment includes:

- Role type classification
- Career trajectory and momentum indicators
- Determinant tier and signal confidence
- Signal skills summary
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Multimodal ranking score
- Hiring recommendation


## How This Repository Fits

This Python repository serves as the execution backbone of the AI Talent Engine.

It:

- Ingests raw and semi-structured talent datasets
- Normalizes and enriches verifiable technical signals
- Evaluates candidates against preset role schemas
- Outputs stable, explainable scoring and export files
- Enables Talent teams to move from research to prioritization to outreach

This README is intended to orient reviewers to the purpose, scope, and architecture of the system before exploring the underlying code.


## Why This Matters

The AI Talent Engine replaces fragmented and manual workflows with a single, auditable research system that:

- Reduces false positives
- Provides explainable ranking and classification
- Aligns Talent Acquisition, Recruiting Operations, and hiring leadership
- Enables earlier identification of high-impact contributors

This is not incremental optimization.

It represents a new operating model for AI talent acquisition that scales with organizational growth and research complexity.


## Project Structure

Refer to in-repository documentation and folder organization for detailed structure and execution flow.


## Getting Started

This repository is designed for controlled demos and research workflows rather than open-ended installation by third parties.

Installation steps, dependencies, usage instructions, and example execution commands should be added here as the system is operationalized or demonstrated.
