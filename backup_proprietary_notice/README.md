# Research-Ops AI Talent Engine

Research-operations-grade AI talent intelligence platform for frontier AI, applied LLM,
RLHF/alignment, and AI infrastructure roles.

## Overview
The Research-Ops AI Talent Engine is a research-first talent intelligence system designed
to classify and validate advanced AI roles using verifiable technical artifacts rather
than resumes, titles, or keyword matching.

The system is explicitly designed as decision support, not decision automation.
All outputs are reviewed and interpreted by expert humans.

## What This System Does
- Classifies AI roles across frontier research, applied ML and LLM engineering, and infrastructure domains
- Extracts and validates technical signals from primary-source engineering and research artifacts
- Reduces false positives caused by self-reported skills and title inflation
- Supports Principal- and Staff-level individual contributor hiring

## Signal Sources
Evidence-based signal extraction across:
- GitHub repositories and commit-level contribution histories
- Hugging Face models and model artifacts
- Google Scholar, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar
- Personal research and lab pages
- Technical portfolios
- Model evaluation and benchmark leaderboards
- Conference artifacts

## System Architecture (High-Level)
- GPT-based multi-agent intelligence layer
- Python orchestration and validation framework
- Deterministic role classification schemas
- Human-in-the-loop review and override layer

## Status
Active development. This repository contains architectural documentation and
production-aligned components for research transparency.

## Disclaimer
This system supports hiring intelligence and research operations.
It does not automate hiring decisions.
