# **AI Talent Engine – Research Tools Menu (Extended)**  

**Introduction**  
I built the **AI Talent Engine** as a research-grade talent intelligence system that offers research-grade mapping of authentic AI engineering talent across the modern AI ecosystem. Unlike résumé or Boolean keyword-based recruiting tools, it analyzes **verifiable technical work** — peer-reviewed publications, open-source model releases, granted patents, repositories, and conference presentations — to surface **high-quality AI talent leads** and **track emerging AI contributors** in real time. The engine uses **structured ranking scores** and validates **strengths and weakness areas** in evaluating code-based evidence and systematic false-positive filtering to ensure every profile is backed by **traceable evidence**. It accurately classifies AI contributors across **Frontier / Foundational LLM Development**, **RLHF / Alignment**, **Applied AI**, and **AI Infrastructure** domains and tracks key indicators like **citation growth**, **cross-lab collaborations**, and **publication frequency**, giving talent leaders a **clear, evidence-based view of who is advancing the field** — and **where to find your next hire**.
