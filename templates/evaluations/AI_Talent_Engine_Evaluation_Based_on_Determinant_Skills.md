# AI Talent Engine — Evaluation Based on Determinant Skills (v3.3)

**Author:** L. David Mendoza  
**System:** AI Talent Engine — Research-First Sourcer Automation  
**Schema Reference:** AI_Talent_Schema_Rules v3.2  
**Classification:** Internal Evaluation Framework  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Introduction

The **AI Talent Engine — Evaluation Based on Determinant Skills** framework defines a structured, evidence-driven methodology for evaluating AI professionals based on **verifiable technical contribution**, not inferred capability, résumé claims, or keyword proximity.

Unlike traditional recruiting or résumé-screening approaches, this framework evaluates **primary technical artifacts** — including peer-reviewed publications, open-source repositories, model releases, patents, and conference participation — to assess authentic contribution, technical depth, and projected impact.

The framework is designed to support **high-stakes AI hiring decisions** across Frontier / Foundational AI, RLHF & Alignment, Applied AI, and AI Infrastructure roles by producing **audit-ready, explainable, and repeatable evaluations** grounded entirely in traceable evidence.
