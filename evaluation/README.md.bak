# FILE: evaluation/README.md
# VERSION: v1.0.0
#
# PURPOSE
# This module implements the evaluation layer that consumes evidence artifacts, applies
# deterministic Tier 1 / Tier 2 gating, and produces structured candidate evaluations.
#
# OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES
# 1) Evidence first. Titles never assign tiers.
# 2) Normalize terminology before scoring.
# 3) Enforce role-locked evaluation against canonical role types.
# 4) Fail closed when evidence is insufficient.
#
# REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE FILES (CURRENT AND FUTURE)
# - evaluation/knowledge/role_determinants.json
# - evaluation/knowledge/model_ecosystem_registry.json
# - evaluation/knowledge/terminology_normalization_map.json
#
# AGENT #51 GOVERNANCE
# Agent #51 monitors naming drift and proposes additive updates to knowledge files.
# Agent #51 must not redefine tiers or add new role types.
#
# VALIDATION
# - python3 -m compileall evaluation
# - python3 -c "from evaluation import evaluate_candidate; print('ok')"
#
# GIT
# - git add evaluation
# - git commit -m "Add evaluation module scaffolding (v1.0.0)"
# - git push
#

## Module files

- `schemas.py`  
  Dataclasses for candidates, evidence, and evaluation outputs.

- `role_determinants.py`  
  Loads role-specific Tier 1 and Tier 2 determinants. Fail-closed enforcement.

- `role_benchmarks.py`  
  Benchmark vocabulary and mappings used in Tier and evidence interpretation.

- `evidence.py`  
  Evidence normalization pipeline. Terminology drift map application.

- `scoring.py`  
  Deterministic tier assignment, EQI computation, and structured evaluation results.

- `ranker.py`  
  Cross-candidate ranking for 10 to 100+ candidate sets.

- `business_impact.py`  
  Executive-readable summary derived from evaluations.

## Output contract

Evaluation outputs are structured and repeatable:
- role_type (canonical)
- tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Indeterminate)
- evidence_hits (explicit, normalized terms)
- EQI score
- strengths and weaknesses
- rationale
