# 🔬 AI Talent Engine — Phase 7: Citation Intelligence Module
**Version:** v7.0  
**Project:** Research-First Sourcer Automation  
**Owner:** AI Talent Engine Development Team

## 1 · Purpose
Phase 7 introduces **Citation Intelligence**, an analytical layer that measures *research influence trajectories* and *collaboration networks* using citation data from Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar.  
It extends Phase 6 outputs to identify:
- High-velocity citation growth (“breakout” researchers)  
- Cross-lab collaboration clusters  
- Citation-based ranking tiers (50 K → 30 K → 10 K → 2.5 K)  
- Co-authorship influence graphs

## 2 · Core Functions

### A · Citation Velocity Layer
Computes relative citation acceleration over the past 24 months.

```python
velocity = citations_last_24mo / total_citations
